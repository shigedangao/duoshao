# Duoshao ⚖️

Leaning a new language is always exciting and full of surprise. During my learning journey I sometimes struggle to choose which word / character to learn. As a result, this app count the number word present in a text and return a list ordered by the number a word has been founded.

The app support multiple platform:

- Windows
- OSX
- Linux

Below is a small gif showing how it works

## Supported language

As this is only a personal project I only added language that I'm currently / start to learn:

- Chinese (Traditional & Simplified are both supported)
- Laotian
